\section{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}
In this paper, we highlighted data processing challenges in the IoT domain, and demonstrated NES, a system that tackles those challenges. We showcased NES through a visualization application for a public transport monitoring system. 
Our application translates user actions on its GUI to NES queries. Using different execution plans, the visitor observes the implications on resource utilization of NES's cross-paradigm operator placements. Using NES as our data management backend, we are able to scale applications in large IoT infrastructures.
% and thus enable new types of IoT applications.
