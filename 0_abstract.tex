\begin{abstract}
Current cloud-based data management systems are not designed for the needs of the upcoming Internet of Things (IoT) applications. In particular, they do not consider heterogeneous setups regarding network topologies and compute nodes. In this demonstration, we showcase one representative use case for the IoT, i.e., a public transport system of a city, and describe its unique challenges. We point out why state-of-the-art data management systems do not qualify for this task and demonstrate NebulaStream (NES) as a system designed for IoT applications. NES unifies data processing techniques from cloud and fog-based systems. By considering the physical network topology and available compute resources, NES minimizes network traffic, and avoids resource over-utilization. Our application on top of NES allows visitors to deploy ad-hoc queries and explore different processing modes. Overall, we show that NES enables future IoT applications that are not realizable with current state-of-the-art systems.
